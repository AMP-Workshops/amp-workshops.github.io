Agile architecture does not necessarily emerge from the use of agile development practices, it needs to be deliberately sought after. This often means creating systems as sets of small, independent components that collaborate to provide the desired functionality. Such components are usually loosely-coupled and expose well-defined APIs that are accessible over standard communication protocols and data formats---they can be individually developed and tested, they can be easily replaced by alternative implementations if needed, and they provide great flexibility when deploying and scaling the system.

This style of architecture is often described as **microservices**. Essentially, microservices decompose a system into an architecture of standalone modules that (i) are simpler to maintain and evolve; (ii) scale efficiently; and (iii) can be reused as building blocks for other architectures. Transitioning to a microservice architecture is crucial for companies in highly-competing markets, where agility and flexibility of software systems become a critical asset to establish leadership.

Transitioning to microservices-based architectures is crucial for companies in highly competitive markets, where the agility and flexibility of software systems are essential.
Microservices as an architectural style facilitate agility, streamline integration and enable more flexible solutions. 
However, an adoption also increases complexity and requires novel software construction techniques and advanced agile engineering practices.
Especially since the rise of large language models (LLMs), development practices increasingly incorporate AI tools, opening a new field of challenges and opportunities for microservices programming.
While microservices are a solution for scalability, maintainability, and evolvability, they come at a cost:
an increased complexity that calls for an improvement of the current techniques for software construction and advanced engineering practices.

The AMP workshop aims to collect experiences on microservice adoption and reporting best practices, as well as failure cases, to build community knowledge based on past mistakes and successes.
We also emphasize the current trend towards AI-driven software engineering practices and the development of data-intensive applications. 
The workshop seeks for solutions and experiences both on both AI-assited tooling, and building data-intensive applications and LLMs using microservices.
The workshop is open to experience reports from practitioners and academics. 
We seek to collect original work on the science and engineering of programming microservices, including but not limited to the following topics:

- Software engineering methods and tools for microservices
- Enable an evolutionary and agile architecture with microservices
- Microservices in the context of AI-based data-intensive applications and LLMs
- Microservices for machine learning model operation management (MLOps)
- AI-enhanced development and refactoring of microservices-based systems
- Programming languages, techniques, and design patterns for microservices
- Operations practices for microservices and DevOps support
- Organizational dynamics and practices of agile teams working with microservices
- Software Quality, metrics, and analytics in microservice architectures
- Testing, verification, and test-driven development for microservices
- Architecture recovery and documentation strategies for microservices 
- Refactoring in the context of microservice architectures
- Empirical studies and experience reports on microservices
- Teaching and learning microservices: education strategies and experiences

AMP 2025 is organized with the official support of the Microservices Community~\cite{MSCOMM}, an international non-profit organization interested in sharing knowledge and fostering collaborations about the paradigm of microservices.
