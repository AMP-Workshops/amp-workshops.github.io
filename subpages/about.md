Scope
----------------------------

Transitioning to microservices-based architectures is crucial for companies in highly competitive markets, where the agility and flexibility of software systems are essential. Microservices as an architectural style facilitate agility, streamline integration and enable more flexible solutions. However, an adoption also increases complexity and requires novel software construction techniques and advanced agile engineering practices. Especially since the rise of large language models (LLMs), development practices increasingly incorporate AI tools, opening a new field of challenges and opportunities for microservices programming.

The Workshop on Agility with Microservices Programming (AMP) aims to collect experiences and studies on microservice architectures, share best practices, report on failure cases, and build a community knowledge base. The fifth edition of AMP aims to continue the success of its previous editions:
