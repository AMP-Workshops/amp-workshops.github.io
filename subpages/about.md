Scope
----------------------------

Agile architecture does not necessarily emerge from the use of agile development practices, it needs to be deliberately sought after. This often means creating systems as sets of small, independent components that collaborate to provide the desired functionality. Such components are usually loosely-coupled and expose well-defined APIs that are accessible over standard communication protocols and data formats---they can be individually developed and tested, they can be easily replaced by alternative implementations if needed, and they provide great flexibility when deploying and scaling the system.

This style of architecture is often described as **microservices**. Essentially, microservices decompose a system into an architecture of standalone modules that (i) are simpler to maintain and evolve; (ii) scale efficiently; and (iii) can be reused as building blocks for other architectures. Transitioning to a microservice architecture is crucial for companies in highly-competing markets, where agility and flexibility of software systems become a critical asset to establish leadership.

Transitioning to microservices-based architectures is crucial for companies in highly competitive markets, where the agility and flexibility of software systems are essential. Microservices as an architectural style facilitate agility, streamline integration and enable more flexible solutions. However, an adoption also increases complexity and requires novel software construction techniques and advanced agile engineering practices. Especially since the rise of large language models (LLMs), development practices increasingly incorporate AI tools, opening a new field of challenges and opportunities for microservices programming.

The Workshop on Agility with Microservices Programming (AMP) aims to collect experiences and studies on microservice architectures, share best practices, report on failure cases, and build a community knowledge base. The fifth edition of AMP aims to continue the success of its previous editions:
