Scope
----------------------------

Agile architecture does not necessarily emerge from the use of agile development practices, it needs to be deliberately sought after. This often means creating systems as sets of small, independent components that collaborate to provide the desired functionality. Such components are usually loosely-coupled and expose well-defined APIs that are accessible over standard communication protocols and data formats---they can be individually developed and tested, they can be easily replaced by alternative implementations if needed, and they provide great flexibility when deploying and scaling the system.

This style of architecture is often described as **microservices**. Essentially, microservices decompose a system into an architecture of standalone modules that (i) are simpler to maintain and evolve; (ii) scale efficiently; and (iii) can be reused as building blocks for other architectures. Transitioning to a microservice architecture is crucial for companies in highly-competing markets, where agility and flexibility of software systems become a critical asset to establish leadership.

However, microservices also come with new challenges. Such distributed architectures are complex to design and require substantial expertise. 
Companies that decide to adopt them will need to adapt their standards, practices, and processes. Furthermore, the introduction of microservices often slows down development, particularly during the migration from a monolithic architecture. 
Yet, transitioning to microservices is crucial for companies in highly competitive markets, where the agility and flexibility of software systems and their development become critical assets to establish leadership. In the era of AI-based systems and LLMs, microservices play a pivotal role 
in building reliable and scalable systems that meet the requirements of such data-intensive applications. AI-assisted architecting, development, and refactoring can help to design new microservices-based systems or modernize monolithic legacy applications efficiently.

The Workshop on Agility with Microservices Programming (AMP) aims to collect experiences and studies on microservice architectures, share best practices, report on failure cases, and build a community knowledge base. The fifth edition of AMP aims to continue the success of its previous editions:
